    Assignment requirements:
    1. Create a GitHub repository for this assignment and clone it to your computer as a subfolder inside of your folder for coursework. 
    2. On Wednesday, you created an HTML-only web page for a topic of your choice (if you have not finished this, please complete that
       before continuing with this assignment). Make a copy of this file inside of your clones repository and more content to the HTML as follows:
        2.1. The navigation bar should have at least 4 items
        2.2. At least 3 images should be included together within a shared container element (div, section)
        2.3. A section with 4-6 different elements should be included (in a recipe page for example, this could be cuisines)
    3. Design the layout and theme for your website (on paper or any visual software). The theme should include the font families you want to use,
       and the page colours. How will the page look on a computer? How will it look on a mobile device? Some requirements:
        3.1. The navigation bar must be included at the top with the menu options side by side 
        3.2. The 3+ images should be displayed side by side in computer mode. In mobile mode the images should be displayed one on top of the other 
        3.3. The 4-6 options should be displayed as a grid. If you want a challenge, make each grid item have multiple sub-elements (eg a picture and a heading) 
        3.4. The form and the table that you created on Wednesday should be styled too 
    4. Now, create a CSS file that will style your web page to match your design. Make sure it is responsive so that it will look as expected on 
       computers vs mobile devices. Hint: Don't forget to link it to your HTML!
    5. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository. Make sure to check that the changes were uploaded correctly on GitHub
